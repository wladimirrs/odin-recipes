    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>0,5 cup flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>6 cups milk</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>0,5 cup butter</li>

        <li>9 bananas</li>

        <li>Cream of tartar</li>

        <li>Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter;
            Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes.
            Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)</li>
            <li>Line the bottom and sides of 2 casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed.</li>
            <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
